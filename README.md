# Titanic-Survival-according-to-other-features
By using EDA analysis of Passenger Survival based on other features for example Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex etc
1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Identify and deal with any missing values in the dataset. For example, the Titanic dataset has missing values in columns like 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'.
Data Type Conversion: Ensure each column has the appropriate data type (e.g., converting 'Age' to a numerical type).
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle any outliers, particularly in numeric columns like 'Fare' and 'Age'.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Examine each variable individually.

For categorical variables (e.g., 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Embarked'), use bar charts to understand the distribution.
For numerical variables (e.g., 'Age', 'Fare'), use histograms or box plots to understand distribution and variability.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables.

Analyze the survival rate across different passenger classes ('Pclass') and genders ('Sex') to identify patterns.
Use scatter plots, heatmaps, or grouped bar charts to study relationships between variables like 'Fare' vs. 'Survived' and 'Age' vs. 'Survived'.
Multivariate Analysis: Look at interactions between multiple variables.

For example, explore survival rate by both 'Pclass' and 'Sex' to identify trends in survival based on class and gender.
3. Identify Patterns and Trends
Summarize key insights, such as:
Higher survival rates in specific classes or for certain demographics (e.g., women and children).
Any correlations between numerical variables and the target variable (e.g., 'Survived').
